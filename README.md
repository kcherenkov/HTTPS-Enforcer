#HTTPS Enforcer Extension for Google Chrome#
The [HTTPS Enforcer extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beaholcfmnpbabojbldnhlikfmnjmoma) makes it easy to ensure youâ€™re connecting to secure sites by rewriting all requests to an HTTPS URL whenever you visit one of the sites HTTPS Enforcer supports.

Original idea and ruleset libraries: [HTTPS Everywhere for Firefox](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)

Extension changes your Google Chrome proxy settings!
